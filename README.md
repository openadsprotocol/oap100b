# The Open Ads Protocol X 100.Builders!

## Welcome to the Open Ads Protocol ðŸ‘‹

We are committed to transforming the landscape of advertising with a vision for a decentralized web. Our mission is to make ads open, decentralized, transparent, and permissionless.


## **Our Mission**

In the evolving digital world, advertising has become an integral part of the internet ecosystem. However, centralized control and opaque systems can lead to a myriad of issues that negatively impact publishers, advertisers, and end users alike.

The Open Ads Protocol is our answer to these challenges - a decentralized protocol that empowers publishers and advertisers by enabling transparency, fostering innovation, and ensuring inclusivity for all participants.


## **The Open Ads Protocol**

Our protocol serves as a decentralized conduit, bridging the gap between advertisers and publishers. It aims to dismantle the prevailing centralized advertising stack, replacing it with an open and transparent infrastructure that benefits all parties involved.

This protocol will ensure that:

Transparency is upheld as every transaction and interaction is recorded on the blockchain, which can be audibly verified by any participant.
Innovation is fostered as the protocol is open-source, inviting developers worldwide to contribute and improve upon it.
Inclusivity is preserved as the protocol allows any publisher or advertiser, regardless of their size, to participate in the advertising ecosystem.


## **Get Involved**

We're always looking for contributors to help us build the future of the web! If you're a developer, designer, or someone with a knack for marketing and communications, we'd love to hear from you.
